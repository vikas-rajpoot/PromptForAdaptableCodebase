Create a simple documentation file in docs/ that explains the [MODULE/COMPONENT NAME] with high-level functionality of each class, method, and file.

Structure the documentation as follows:

1. **Architecture Overview** - Brief explanation of the design pattern and organization
2. **Core Components** - List main classes with:
   - Purpose and responsibilities
   - Key methods and their functions
   - Important signals/events (if applicable)
   - How they interact with other components
3. **Supporting Components** - Secondary classes and utilities
4. **Data Flow** - How information moves through the system
5. **Key Features** - Main functionality highlights
6. **Thread Safety/Concurrency** - If applicable

For each component, focus on:
- What it does (purpose)
- Why it exists (responsibilities) 
- How it fits in the bigger picture
- Key public methods only (not implementation details)

Keep it concise but comprehensive - suitable for onboarding developers or architectural reference.
